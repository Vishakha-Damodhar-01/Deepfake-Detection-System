# 🛡️ DeepSentinel AI  
### An Uncertainty-Aware Deepfake Detection System using MobileNetV2  
live demo [DeepSentinel AI](https://deepsentinel-ai.streamlit.app/)


## 📌 Overview  
DeepSentinel AI is a deep learning-based system designed to detect deepfake content in **images, videos, and real-time webcam streams**.  
The system leverages **MobileNetV2** with **transfer learning** and introduces an **uncertainty-aware multi-inference mechanism** to improve prediction reliability.

Unlike traditional deepfake detection systems, DeepSentinel AI not only classifies content as *real* or *fake* but also identifies **uncertain cases**, making it more robust for real-world cybersecurity applications.
